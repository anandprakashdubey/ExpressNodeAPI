In package.json after main add below code if Node version is above 14 so it will allow us to use import statement

// "type":"module",

else we can use babel to make import work with node 10 version

Initially, if we want to run express page, we can use "node index.js" it will run. but to make like webpack we need nodemon
After install nodemon, in package we add command as start: nodemon index.js(or start.js)


Following Commands

npm install --save express
npm install --save-dev nodemon
